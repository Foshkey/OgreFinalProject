This was the final project of my Game Engines class. The goal of this project was to create an implementation of a game engine, demonstrating the abilities of such an engine in some sort of fashion. Various requirements were listed, such as implementation of gameplay, physics, GUI, and audio.

Another personal goal of mine was to implement all open-source modules. These modules include Ogre3D, Crazy Eddie GUI, Bullet Physics Engine, and Audiere.

There is quite a bit of code in this project that would not immediately make sense to the reader, so I plan on posting a YouTube video demonstrating this project in the near future.
